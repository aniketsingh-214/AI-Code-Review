# AI Code Review

A lightweight, customizable AI-powered tool for automating code review in GitHub Pull Requests or local changes, powered by OpenAI (or other LLM backends).

## üöÄ Features

- Reviews pull requests and diffs automatically using an AI model  
- Flags issues like bugs, security, style deviations, and complexity  
- Supports human-friendly line-by-line comments with explanations  
- Integrates via GitHub Actions or local CLI workflows  
- Fully configurable: models, prompts, ignore/include patterns

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. GitHub Action Setup

- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your repository‚Äôs Secrets
- Create `.github/workflows/ci-review.yml` with content similar to:

  ```yaml
  name: AI Code Review
  on:
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  jobs:
    review:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Run AI code review
          uses: your‚Äëusername/AI‚ÄëCode‚ÄëReview@main
          with:
            OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
            MODEL: gpt‚Äë4
            EXCLUDE: "**/*.md,**/test/**"
            # other configs as needed
````

* Push to your repo‚Äîon new pull requests, the tool will analyze diffs and post comments.

### 2. Local CLI Use

* Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt   # if Python-based
  # or npm install, yarn install, etc.
  ```

* Run review:

  ```bash
  ai-review --path . --branch feature-branch
  ```

  and optionally:

  ```bash
  ai-review --diff main..feature-branch --output report.md
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Place a config file like `review.config.yml` or use environment variables:

```yaml
api_key: YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
prompt: "You are a senior software engineer reviewing code diffs. Provide inline feedback concisely."
ignore:
  - node_modules/**
  - docs/**
include:
  - src/**/*.js
  - src/**/*.py
```

## üß™ Example Usage

After opening a pull request:

* The bot scans changed files
* Detects issues like unused variables, missing tests, potential security concerns
* Posts comments back to the PR with suggestions and explanations

## üßæ Output Formats

* Inline GitHub PR comments
* Markdown summary files (e.g. `code-review-report.md`)
* JSON output for machine processing

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`feature/‚Ä¶` or `fix/‚Ä¶`)
3. Make your changes and update the README/docs
4. Submit a pull request
5. Ensure CI tests pass

Please follow the coding style in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Why Use This Tool?

AI‚Äëdriven review tools like **Gito** or **CodeRabbit** ‚Äî provide rapid automated feedback, and help enforce consistency, security, and best practices across your team‚Äôs codebase ([github.com][1], [github.com][2], [github.com][3], [dev.to][4], [github.com][5]).
Similar GitHub Actions like **AI Code Reviewer** by‚ÄØvillesau use GPT‚Äë4 to comment inline on PR diffs and are trusted by many teams for fast integration and good defaults ([github.com][1]).

## üìö More Context on AI Code Review

* AI code reviews rely on ML & NLP to analyze code diffs, detect patterns, flag vulnerabilities, and generate improvement suggestions automatically, speeding up development and offloading repetitive tasks ([github.com][2]).
* These tools boost developer productivity, reduce manual review effort, and support consistent coding standards‚Äîthough final merge decisions should remain human authenticated ([github.blog][6]).
